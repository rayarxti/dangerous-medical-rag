Here are some of the most common issues:\n\n### Early Complications (Within 30 days post-surgery)\n1. **Infection**: The wound around the ileostomy can become infected, typically treated with antibiotics[2, 4].\n2. **Dehydration**: Due to the loss of the large intestine's water absorption function, patients are at risk of dehydration, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance and other severe conditions[1, 2, 3].\n3. **Skin Irritation**: Skin irritation, itching, sores, and infections around the stoma are common early complications[1, 3, 4].\n4. **Bleeding**: Bleeding can occur from the stoma itself or from inside the small intestine[2, 3, 5].\n5. **Necrosis**: Tissue death around the stoma can occur, requiring urgent management[1].\n6. **Retraction**: The stoma can retract into the abdomen, causing leakage and skin damage[1, 2, 3].\n\n### Late Complications (After 30 days post-surgery)\n1. **Bowel Obstruction**: Blockage of the stoma can prevent waste and gas from passing through, leading to abdominal swelling, pain, nausea, and vomiting[1, 2, 3, 4].\n2. **Stomal Prolapse**: The stoma can protrude too far above the skin, leading to complications such as parastomal hernia, skin excoriation, and bleeding[1, 2, 3].\n3. **Parastomal Hernia**: A hernia can occur around the stoma, causing swelling under the skin[1, 2, 4].\n4. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: Removal of part of the intestine can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, causing symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and neurological problems[4].\n5. **Pouchitis**: Inflammation of an internal pouch (in cases of ileo-anal pouch or continent ileostomy) can occur, typically treated with antibiotics[4].\n6. **High-Output Stoma**: High output can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, especially in patients with short bowel syndrome or other conditions like Crohn's disease[1].\n\nThese complications can significantly impact the quality of life of patients with an ileostomy, emphasizing the importance of regular surveillance and follow-up by a multidisciplinary team[1].\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://www.scielo.br/j/jcol/a/ZKf83zSNcFwd6dyqwhMTdsm/\n[2] https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ileostomy/complications/\n[3] https://www.fairviewrehab.com/nursing-care/common-complications-of-an-ileostomy/\n[4] https://www.nhsinform.scot/tests-and-treatments/surgical-procedures/ileostomy/\n[5] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/21726-ileostomy\n""","""Complications of an ileostomy can be categorized into early and late complications.

Here are some of the key complications:\n\n### Immediate Complications\n1. **Infection**: Urinary tract infections can occur due to bacteria entering the urine from the stoma or ileum. Symptoms include fever, pain around the kidneys, and changes in urine output[2, 4].\n2. **Bleeding**: Bleeding from the stoma can be normal if minor, but excessive bleeding may indicate a more serious issue such as damage to large blood vessels or infection[2, 4, 5].\n3. **Pain and Bulging**: Pain and bulging in the abdomen can indicate complications such as hernias or intestinal obstruction[1, 4].\n4. **Stoma Changes**: Significant changes in the stoma's size, shape, color, or odor can be signs of complications such as retraction, prolapse, or stricture[1, 4].\n\n### Long-Term Complications\n1. **Hernias**: Hernias can occur at the stoma site due to weakness in the abdominal wall, leading to bulging and potential intestinal obstruction[1, 2, 5].\n2. **Urinary Tract Issues**: Chronic urinary tract infections, backflow of urine into the kidneys, and kidney stones can occur due to the altered anatomy[3, 5].\n3. **Metabolic Issues**: Long-term exposure of bowel tissue to urine can lead to metabolic acidosis, osteopenia, and vitamin B12 deficiency[3].\n4. **Bowel Issues**: Use of the ileum for urinary diversion can cause chronic bowel issues such as malabsorption of fats and vitamins, gallstones, and changes in bowel habits[3].\n5. **Cancer Risk**: There is an increased risk of colon polyps and cancer in the part of the bowel used for the reservoir, particularly if tobacco products are used[3].\n6. **Mucus Production**: The bowel segment used in urostomy continues to produce mucus, which can clog the stoma and cause other complications[2, 3].\n7. **Leakage**: Frequent leaks from the urostomy pouch can indicate a need for adjustment or a faulty pouch system[4, 5].\n\n### Psychological and Social Complications\n1. **Psychological Impact**: Living with a urostomy can have psychological effects and impact relationships[3].\n2. **Skin Problems**: Skin irritation around the stoma can occur due to improper fitting of the urostomy pouch or pre-existing skin conditions[2, 4].\n\nIt is essential to monitor for these complications and seek medical help promptly if any unusual symptoms or problems arise.

36,what are complications of hepatectomy,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Complications of hepatectomy, a surgical procedure to remove part of the liver, can be serious and include various risks. Here are some of the key complications:\n\n1. **Liver Failure**: This is one of the most severe complications, occurring when the remaining liver tissue is insufficient to support normal liver function. It can lead to progressive jaundice, ascites, and coagulopathy, and may result in death if the liver does not regenerate in a timely manner[3, 4].\n\n2. **Bile Leakage**: Bile can leak from the cut surface of the liver, occurring in about 5-10% of patients. This can cause pain, nausea, and fever, and may require external drainage, endoscopic procedures, or reoperation[1, 3, 5].\n\n3. **Bleeding**: There is a risk of bleeding during or after the operation, which may require blood transfusions or reoperation. This is particularly concerning in liver surgery due to the high volume of blood passing through the liver[3, 5].\n\n4. **Infection**: Infections can occur at the surgical site, in the chest, or in the urinary tract. Symptoms include redness and soreness at the wound site, cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Antibiotics may be needed to treat these infections[3, 5].\n\n5. **Liver Abscess**: This is an infection within the liver, which can occur as a result of cutting through the liver tissue. It is more common after liver ablation than after hepatectomy[3].\n\n6. **Respiratory Complications**: Prolonged ventilator support and poor inspiratory effort post-operatively can lead to respiratory infections, lung collapse, and fluid collections. Early mobilization is important to prevent these complications[3, 5].\n\n7. **Kidney Problems**: There is a risk that the kidneys may stop working properly after the operation, necessitating close monitoring of blood test results and urine output[5].\n\n8. **Posthepatectomy Liver Failure (PHLF)**: This is a serious complication that can occur due to insufficient liver remnant volume or poor liver quality. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates[2, 4].\n\n9. **Postoperative Ascites**: Fluid accumulation in the abdomen can occur due to liver failure or other postoperative complications[2, 4].\n\n10. **Perioperative Death**: There is a risk of death associated with any operation, including liver resection.

Here are some of the key complications:\n\n### Immediate and Short-Term Complications\n1. **Delayed Graft Function (Acute Tubular Necrosis - ATN):** The transplanted kidney may not function immediately, requiring dialysis until it starts working. This can be due to factors such as low blood pressure during CPR, prolonged storage of the kidney, or unexpected bleeding during surgery[1, 3].\n\n2. **Primary Non-Function:** The transplanted kidney never starts working, which is rare but can happen. This usually requires removal of the transplanted kidney and continuation of dialysis[1].\n\n3. **Infection:** Transplant recipients are at increased risk of infections due to immunosuppressive medications. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent infections in the first few months after transplant[1, 2, 4].\n\n4. **Urine Leak:** The ureter can pull away from the bladder, causing urine to leak into the surrounding area. This requires surgical intervention to reconnect the ureter[1, 2].\n\n5. **Bleeding:** Bleeding can occur during or after surgery, which may require additional medical intervention[2].\n\n6. **Blockage of Blood Vessels:** The blood vessels to the new kidney can become blocked, which is a serious complication[2].\n\n### Long-Term Complications\n1. **Rejection:** The immune system may reject the transplanted kidney, which can be acute or chronic. This is managed with immunosuppressive medications, but it requires careful monitoring[2, 4, 5].\n\n2. **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):** This is a common complication, often due to the side effects of immunosuppressive medications. It can lead to heart disease and stroke if not managed properly[3, 4].\n\n3. **Diabetes:** Some immunosuppressive medications can cause diabetes mellitus, which requires additional medical management[3, 4].\n\n4. **Cancer:** Transplant patients are at increased risk of certain cancers, such as lymphoma, skin cancer, and cervical cancer, due to the immunosuppressed state[3, 5].\n\n5. **Heart Disease:** High blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels, often caused by immunosuppressive drugs, can lead to heart disease[3, 5].\n\n6. **Osteoporosis and Hyperlipidemia:** These can occur as side effects of immunosuppressive medications and require additional medical management[4].\n\nUnderstanding these complications is crucial for managing and preventing them, and regular follow-up with the transplant team is essential for monitoring and addressing any issues that may arise.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://health.ucdavis.edu/transplant/about/potential-complications-after-transplant-surgery.html\n[2] https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/kidney-transplant\n[3] http://www.beaumont.ie/kidneycentre-forpatients-aguide-complications\n[4] https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/k/kidney-transplant-complications\n[5] https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/organ-transplantation/kidney/benefits-and-risks-of-a-kidney-transplant/risks-of-a-kidney-transplant/longer-term-risks-of-a-kidney-transplant/\n'","'Complications of kidney transplant can be categorized into immediate, short-term, and long-term risks.

It can be treated with high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs[3, 4].\n   - **Chronic Rejection**: Also known as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), this is a major cause of death within the first year after lung transplantation. It is more difficult to treat and can lead to graft failure[2, 3].\n\n3. **Other Medical Complications**:\n   - **Gastrointestinal Complications**: These can include peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, and bowel obstruction[1, 2].\n   - **Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD)**: This is a spectrum of abnormal B-cell proliferative responses, ranging from benign polyclonal hyperplasia to malignant lymphomas, often associated with Epstein-Barr virus[1, 2].\n   - **Lung Cancer**: This can occur in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis, and may be incidentally detected in the explanted lung at the time of transplantation[1].\n   - **Surgical Complications**: These can include bleeding, blood clots, blockage of the blood vessels to the new lung(s), blockage of the airways, and pulmonary edema[4, 5].\n\nThese complications highlight the need for careful management and monitoring of lung transplant recipients to ensure optimal outcomes.\n\n\n",lung transplant,False,False,0.0

86,what are complications of metal hip implants,12/20/2024,aio,"'Complications of metal hip implants, particularly ""metal-on-metal"" designs, can include: metallosis (tissue damage from metal debris), adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR) causing pain and implant loosening, metal ions entering the bloodstream, bone damage around the implant, pain, implant failure, and the need for revision surgery; in rare cases, systemic effects like allergic reactions or issues with the heart, kidneys, or nervous system may occur. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \n\nKey points about metal hip implant complications: [2, 4, 5]  \n\n\n\n- Metallosis: The primary concern with metal-on-metal implants, where tiny metal particles wear off and can irritate surrounding tissues, causing pain, inflammation, and tissue damage. [2, 4, 5]  \n\n- ALTR (Adverse Local Tissue Reaction): A localized reaction to the metal debris, leading to pain, swelling, and implant loosening.

Here are some of the common complications associated with mesh implants for pelvic organ prolapse (POP):\n\n1. **Mesh Erosion**: This is one of the most common complications, where the mesh wears through the vaginal wall, leading to symptoms such as bleeding, discharge, and pain[1, 2, 4].\n\n2. **Pain**: Chronic pelvic pain, including pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), is a frequent complaint among women who have undergone mesh implantation for POP[1, 2, 4].\n\n3. **Infection**: Infections can occur due to the mesh, leading to symptoms such as fever, swelling, and discharge[1, 2, 4].\n\n4. **Vaginal Bleeding**: Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting can be a complication of mesh erosion or exposure[1, 2, 4].\n\n5. **Vaginal Discharge**: Abnormal vaginal discharge can be a symptom of mesh complications, including erosion or infection[1, 2, 4].\n\n6. **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**: Recurring UTIs can be a complication of mesh placement, particularly if the mesh erodes into the bladder or urethra[1, 2, 4].\n\n7. **Bladder Control Problems**: Incontinence or difficulty emptying the bladder can occur due to mesh complications[1, 2, 4].\n\n8. **Fistulas**: Abnormal connections between the vagina and bladder or rectum can form as a result of mesh erosion[1, 2, 4].\n\n9. **Organ Perforation**: The mesh can perforate nearby organs, such as the bladder, bowel, or blood vessels, leading to serious complications[1, 2, 4].\n\n10. **Scar Tissue Formation**: The body may form scar tissue around the mesh, leading to contraction and tightening of the vaginal tissue[1, 2, 4].\n\n11. **Neuro-muscular Problems**: Some women may experience neuro-muscular issues, including pain and dysfunction in the pelvic floor muscles[1, 2, 4].\n\n12. **Recurrent Prolapse**: Despite the use of mesh, some women may experience recurrent prolapse, requiring further surgical intervention[1, 2, 4].\n\nIt is essential for women considering mesh placement for POP to discuss these potential complications with their healthcare provider and to be vigilant for any adverse events post-surgery.

124,surgery complications of laparoscopic sigmoid resection,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Laparoscopic sigmoid resection is a common surgical procedure for conditions such as diverticulitis, and while it offers several benefits over open surgery, including less postoperative pain and a lower morbidity rate, it can still lead to various complications. Here are some of the key complications associated with laparoscopic sigmoid resection:\n\n1. **Anastomotic Leakage**: This is one of the most serious complications, occurring in 2.9% to 15.3% of cases[1, 3]. It involves leakage from the anastomosis (the connection made between the remaining parts of the intestine), which can lead to infection, abscesses, and potentially life-threatening conditions.\n\n2. **Bleeding**: Postoperative bleeding is another complication, occurring in 0.5% to 1% of cases[1]. It can be internal or external and may require additional surgical intervention.\n\n3. **Ureteral Injury**: This complication occurs in about 1% of cases[1]. It involves damage to the ureters, which can lead to urinary tract infections, fistulas, or other urinary complications.\n\n4. **Surgical Site Infections**: These are infections that occur at the site of the surgery, affecting about 5% of patients[1]. They can range from superficial skin infections to deeper infections involving the abdominal cavity.\n\n5. **Internal Hernia**: This is a rare but potentially serious complication, occurring in 0.38% to 0.5% of cases[1]. It involves the herniation of intestinal loops through mesenteric gaps created during the surgery, which can lead to bowel obstruction and ischemia.\n\n6. **Ileus**: This is a condition where the intestines do not function properly after surgery, leading to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It is one of the most common complications after elective colon resection, affecting about 11.8% of patients[4].\n\n7. **Incisional Surgical Site Infections**: These are infections that occur at the incision site, affecting about 7% of patients[4].\n\n8. **Cardiac, Renal, Pulmonary, and Neurological Complications**: These can include myocardial infarction, renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and neurological deficits, although they are less common[3, 4].\n\nTo minimize these complications, surgeons often emphasize the importance of meticulous technique, including the closure of mesenteric gaps to prevent internal hernias[1]. Additionally, early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these complications effectively.\n\n### References:\n- [1] **Two cases of an internal hernia after laparoscopic sigmoid resection**.

It involves leakage from the anastomosis (the connection made between the remaining parts of the intestine), which can lead to infection, abscesses, and potentially life-threatening conditions.\n\n2. **Bleeding**: Postoperative bleeding is another complication, occurring in 0.5% to 1% of cases[1]. It can be internal or external and may require additional surgical intervention.\n\n3. **Ureteral Injury**: This complication occurs in about 1% of cases[1]. It involves damage to the ureters, which can lead to urinary tract infections, fistulas, or other urinary complications.\n\n4. **Surgical Site Infections**: These are infections that occur at the site of the surgery, affecting about 5% of patients[1]. They can range from superficial skin infections to deeper infections involving the abdominal cavity.\n\n5. **Internal Hernia**: This is a rare but potentially serious complication, occurring in 0.38% to 0.5% of cases[1]. It involves the herniation of intestinal loops through mesenteric gaps created during the surgery, which can lead to bowel obstruction and ischemia.\n\n6. **Ileus**: This is a condition where the intestines do not function properly after surgery, leading to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It is one of the most common complications after elective colon resection, affecting about 11.8% of patients[4].\n\n7. **Incisional Surgical Site Infections**: These are infections that occur at the incision site, affecting about 7% of patients[4].\n\n8. **Cardiac, Renal, Pulmonary, and Neurological Complications**: These can include myocardial infarction, renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and neurological deficits, although they are less common[3, 4].\n\nTo minimize these complications, surgeons often emphasize the importance of meticulous technique, including the closure of mesenteric gaps to prevent internal hernias[1]. Additionally, early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these complications effectively.\n\n### References:\n- [1] **Two cases of an internal hernia after laparoscopic sigmoid resection**.

132,surgery complications of exploratory laparotomy,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Exploratory laparotomy is a major surgical procedure that involves opening the abdomen to explore and diagnose conditions affecting various organs within the abdominal cavity.

Here are some of the key issues that can arise:\n\n### Early Complications (Within 30 Days Post-Surgery)\n1. **Infection**: The wound around the ileostomy can become infected, which is typically treated with antibiotics[2, 5].\n2. **Dehydration**: Ileostomies can lead to dehydration due to the loss of water and electrolytes, which can cause fatigue, dry mouth, and other symptoms[2, 3].\n3. **Bleeding**: Bleeding can occur from the stoma site, which may require medical attention if it becomes significant[3].\n4. **Skin Irritation**: Skin irritation around the stoma is common, leading to itching, sores, and infections. Proper care and cleaning can help prevent this[3, 5].\n5. **Necrosis**: Stoma necrosis can occur due to inadequate blood supply, requiring urgent surgical intervention[1].\n\n### Late Complications (After 30 Days Post-Surgery)\n1. **Stoma Retraction**: The stoma can retract back into the abdomen, causing issues with stoma bag fit and potentially leading to skin irritation and infection[1, 3].\n2. **Stoma Prolapse**: The stoma can protrude too far, increasing the risk of abrasions and infections. This can be managed with different types of stoma bags and accessories[1, 3].\n3. **Obstruction**: Blockage of the stoma can prevent waste and gas from passing through, causing abdominal swelling, pain, nausea, and vomiting. This may require dietary changes, massage, or further surgery[2, 3].\n4. **Parastomal Hernia**: A hernia can occur around the stoma site, causing swelling under the skin, which may need surgical repair[2, 5].\n5. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: Removal of part of the intestine can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, causing symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and neurological problems[5].\n\n### General Considerations\n- **Psychological Impact**: Complications can have a significant psychological impact, leading to anxiety, depression, and lowered self-esteem[1].\n- **Multidisciplinary Care**: Regular follow-up and surveillance by a multidisciplinary team are crucial for managing and preventing complications[1].\n- **Emergency Situations**: Severe complications such as bowel rupture or severe infection require immediate medical attention[2, 5].\n\nUnderstanding these potential complications can help in early detection and management, improving the quality of life for patients with an ileostomy.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://www.scielo.br/j/jcol/a/ZKf83zSNcFwd6dyqwhMTdsm/\n[2] https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ileostomy/complications/\n[3] https://www.fairviewrehab.com/nursing-care/common-complications-of-an-ileostomy/\n[4] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/ostomy-reversal\n[5] https://www.nhsinform.scot/tests-and-treatments/surgical-procedures/ileostomy/\n'","'Surgery complications of an ileostomy can be categorized into early and late complications.

Here are some of the common complications:\n\n### Immediate Complications\n1. **Bleeding and Infection**: Like any major surgery, there is a risk of bleeding and infection after colostomy surgery[1, 3].\n2. **Stoma Complications**: Early complications include bleeding from the stoma, lack of blood supply to the stoma, retraction (sinking below the skin level), and separation of the stoma from the surrounding skin[1, 2].\n3. **Intestinal Obstruction**: Blockage of food, fluids, air, or stool moving through the intestines can occur due to adhesions, scar tissue, or other factors[1, 2, 4].\n\n### Long-term Complications\n1. **Stoma Complications**:\n   - **Hernia**: Abdominal contents bulging through a weak area in the abdominal wall near the stoma, which can lead to intestinal blockage or loss of blood supply[1, 2, 4].\n   - **Prolapse**: Part of the intestine pushes through the stoma, which can become stuck and lose its blood supply[1, 2, 4].\n   - **Retraction**: The stoma sinks below the skin level, making it difficult to attach and secure the ostomy bag[1, 2, 4].\n   - **Stricture**: Narrowing of the stoma, making it difficult for intestinal contents to pass through[1, 2, 4].\n\n2. **Skin Complications**:\n   - **Irritation**: Skin irritation due to leakage from the stoma, improper fitting of the ostomy pouch, or irritation from applying or changing the pouch[1, 2, 4].\n   - **Infection**: Bacterial or fungal infections around the stoma site[1, 2, 4].\n\n3. **Nutritional Complications**:\n   - **Dehydration**: More common if a large portion of the intestine was removed or bypassed, leading to increased water content in the stoma output[1, 2, 4].\n   - **Nutrient Absorption**: Problems absorbing nutrients if part of the small intestine was removed or bypassed[1, 2, 4].\n\n4. **Other Complications**:\n   - **Parastomal Hernia**: A hernia that develops near the stoma site, which may require medical intervention[2, 4, 5].\n   - **Necrosis**: Death of tissue around the stoma due to reduced blood supply, infection, or other factors, which requires immediate medical attention[2, 4].\n\nIt is crucial to follow post-surgical care instructions and maintain regular follow-up appointments with healthcare providers to monitor for these complications and address them promptly if they occur.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/ostomy-surgery-bowel/complications\n[2] https://www.byramhealthcare.com/blogs/10-common-stoma-issues-and-complications\n[3] https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/ostomy-reversal\n[4] https://www.healthline.com/health/colorectal-cancer/colostomy-complications\n[5] https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/colostomy/risks/\n'","'Complications of colostomy surgery can be categorized into immediate and long-term issues.

148,surgery complications of suprapubic catheter,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Surgery complications of suprapubic catheter insertion can be categorized into short-term and long-term issues. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n### Short-Term Complications:\n1. **Bleeding**: Bleeding from the site of insertion is a common complication. Prolonged bleeding may indicate a bowel injury[1, 2].\n2. **Infection**: Infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs) and wound infections, can occur. Febrile UTIs are particularly common in the early stages[1, 5].\n3. **Perforation**: Perforation of the bowel or bladder is a rare but serious complication that may require further surgery[2, 3].\n4. **Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO)**: SBO can occur due to misplacement of the catheter or during routine catheter changes. It may present with abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and vomiting[3].\n5. **General Surgical Risks**: These include cardiovascular and pulmonary complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accident[2].\n\n### Long-Term Complications:\n1. **Catheter Blockage**: Blockages can occur due to encrustations or biofilm formation, leading to urinary retention and potential stone formation[1, 3].\n2. **Tract Loss**: The suprapubic tract can close off if the catheter falls out and is not promptly reinserted[4].\n3. **Tract Stenosis**: Narrowing of the tract can make catheter insertion difficult and may require dilatation[1].\n4. **Urethral Leakage**: Urine leakage around the catheter or through the urethra can occur, sometimes necessitating removal of the SPC[1, 2].\n5. **Overgranulation**: Overgrowth of tissue at the cystostomy site can lead to bleeding and discomfort during catheter changes. This can be managed with topical treatments like silver nitrate or hydrocortisone cream[1].\n6. **Bladder Stones**: The formation of bladder stones can occur due to the shedding of crystals from the catheter into the bladder[1].\n7. **Catheter Dislodgement**: Accidental dislodgement of the catheter can lead to tract closure and other complications[1].\n\n### General Considerations:\n- **Patient Satisfaction**: Despite potential complications, many patients prefer SPCs over urethral catheters due to comfort and convenience[5].\n- **Risk Awareness**: Both patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential complications associated with SPC insertion to ensure proper management and follow-up care[5].\n\n### References:\n- [1] https://www.urotoday.com/library-resources/suprapubic-catheter/144205-spc-related-complications-and-problems.html\n- [2] https://continencematters.com/surgery-and-procedures/suprapubic-catheter-insertion/\n- [3] https://www.emdocs.net/suprapubic-catheter-complications-tips-tricks/\n- [4] https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/permanent-suprapubic-catheterisation-in-men-frequently-asked-questions/\n- [5] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16551422/\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://www.urotoday.com/library-resources/suprapubic-catheter/144205-spc-related-complications-and-problems.html\n[2] https://continencematters.com/surgery-and-procedures/suprapubic-catheter-insertion/\n[3] https://www.emdocs.net/suprapubic-catheter-complications-tips-tricks/\n[4] https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/permanent-suprapubic-catheterisation-in-men-frequently-asked-questions/\n[5] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16551422/\n'","'Surgery complications of suprapubic catheter insertion can be categorized into short-term and long-term issues.

156,surgery complications of hepatectomy,1/2/2025,perplexity,"""Hepatectomy, or liver resection, is a surgical procedure to remove part of the liver. While it is a curative treatment for various liver conditions, including benign and malignant tumors, it carries several potential complications. Here are some of the key complications associated with hepatectomy:\n\n1. **Liver Failure**:\n   - **Posthepatectomy Liver Failure (PHLF):** This is one of the most severe complications, occurring when the remaining liver tissue is insufficient to support normal liver function. It can lead to progressive jaundice, ascites, and coagulopathy, and may result in death if the liver does not regenerate in a timely manner[2, 3, 4].\n   - **Risk Factors:** The risk of PHLF increases with the extent of liver resection and is higher in patients with pre-existing liver disease or cirrhosis[2, 4].\n\n2. **Biliary Complications**:\n   - **Bile Leakage:** This is a common complication, occurring in 5-10% of patients. It can cause pain, sickness, and a high temperature, and may require external drainage or endoscopic procedures to decompress the bile ducts. Rarely, reoperation may be necessary[1, 3, 5].\n   - **Biliary Strictures:** These can occur due to scarring of the bile ducts and may require further surgical or endoscopic intervention.\n\n3. **Infectious Complications**:\n   - **Liver Abscess:** This is an infection within the liver that can occur as a result of cutting through the liver tissue. It is more common following liver ablation[3].\n   - **Infection around the Surgical Site:** This includes wound infections and intra-abdominal abscesses, which can be treated with antibiotics or may require drainage[3, 5].\n\n4. **Vascular Complications**:\n   - **Bleeding:** This can occur during or after surgery and may require blood transfusion or reoperation. The risk is higher due to the liver's rich blood supply and its role in blood clotting[3, 4, 5].\n   - **Thrombosis and Ischemia:** These can occur due to vascular injury or clotting disorders.\n\n5. **Respiratory Complications**:\n   - **Pneumonia and Atelectasis:** These can occur due to prolonged ventilator support and poor inspiratory effort postoperatively. Early mobilization is crucial to prevent these complications[3, 5].\n\n6. **General Surgical Risks**:\n   - **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism:** These are general risks associated with any major surgery[3].\n   - **Hernia at the Incision Site:** This can occur as a late complication.\n\n7. **Mortality**:\n   - **Operative Mortality:** The risk of dying within the perioperative period is approximately 2% for liver resection, depending on the extent of resection, liver quality, and other medical conditions[3].\n\nUnderstanding these complications is crucial for preoperative planning and postoperative management to minimize risks and improve outcomes for patients undergoing hepatectomy.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/211502\n[2] https://atm.amegroups.org/article/view/60650/html\n[3] https://www.hpbsurgery.co.nz/liver-surgery/\n[4] https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/rg.210124\n[5] https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/liver-cancer/treatment/surgery/problems-after-surgery\n""","""Hepatectomy, or liver resection, is a surgical procedure to remove part of the liver.

It is more common following liver ablation[3].\n   - **Infection around the Surgical Site:** This includes wound infections and intra-abdominal abscesses, which can be treated with antibiotics or may require drainage[3, 5].\n\n4. **Vascular Complications**:\n   - **Bleeding:** This can occur during or after surgery and may require blood transfusion or reoperation. The risk is higher due to the liver's rich blood supply and its role in blood clotting[3, 4, 5].\n   - **Thrombosis and Ischemia:** These can occur due to vascular injury or clotting disorders.\n\n5. **Respiratory Complications**:\n   - **Pneumonia and Atelectasis:** These can occur due to prolonged ventilator support and poor inspiratory effort postoperatively. Early mobilization is crucial to prevent these complications[3, 5].\n\n6. **General Surgical Risks**:\n   - **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism:** These are general risks associated with any major surgery[3].\n   - **Hernia at the Incision Site:** This can occur as a late complication.\n\n7. **Mortality**:\n   - **Operative Mortality:** The risk of dying within the perioperative period is approximately 2% for liver resection, depending on the extent of resection, liver quality, and other medical conditions[3].\n\nUnderstanding these complications is crucial for preoperative planning and postoperative management to minimize risks and improve outcomes for patients undergoing hepatectomy.\n\n\n",hepatectomy,True,True,1.0

Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Airway Complications**:\n   - **Incidence**: 5-15%, higher in patients with infectious diseases like bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis[1].\n   - **Types**: Bronchial suture dehiscence, mucosa membrane inflammation, and persisting secretions.\n   - **Risk Factors**: Firm pleuropulmonary adhesions, ischemia time, hemodynamic instability during surgery, and high doses of amines postoperatively[1].\n\n2. **Vascular Complications**:\n   - **Pulmonary Vein Obstruction**: Early complication causing severe symptoms like hypoxia, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary infiltrates. Diagnosis is often made with transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram or chest CT angiography[1].\n   - **Bleeding**: Rarely due to vascular sutures; more commonly from divided pleural adhesions[1].\n\n3. **Pleural Complications**:\n   - **Hemothorax**: Most common complication requiring additional surgical procedures. It can occur early or weeks after the transplant, often due to bleeding from pleural adhesions[1].\n   - **Risk Factors**: Firm pleuropulmonary adhesions, previous surgery (e.g., talc pleurodesis), bypass circulation during transplant, and pretransplant anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy[1].\n\n4. **Surgical Wound Complications**:\n   - **Phrenic Nerve Injury**: Most serious, impacting cough capacity and respiratory mechanics. High-risk patients include those with firm pleuropulmonary adhesions to the mediastinum and those receiving double-lung transplants[1].\n\n5. **Abdominal Complications**:\n   - **Paralytic Ileus**: Common (30-50%), caused by prolonged operative time, postoperative epidural analgesia, immunosuppressive drugs, and water-electrolyte balance impairment. Therapy includes NPO diet and adjusting medication and hydration[1].\n   - **Bowel Perforations**: High mortality rates, often requiring emergency surgery.

Blood clot formation can be reduced by using compression stockings, mild blood thinners, and early mobilization[1].\n   - **Intestinal issues**: After abdominal surgery, the intestines may temporarily ""fall asleep"" and not function properly, but this usually resolves within a few days[1].\n\n2. **Adrenal Insufficiency**:\n   - **Life-threatening condition**: This occurs when the body does not produce enough steroids. Patients who have one adrenal gland removed and the other is normal have a low risk, but those with Cushing\'s Syndrome or who have both glands removed are at higher risk and need close monitoring and possibly steroid replacement[1].\n\n3. **Injury to Surrounding Organs**:\n   - **Risk of damage to nearby organs**: During surgery, organs like the spleen, kidney, pancreas, and blood vessels can be injured. The spleen is particularly at risk during left-sided surgery and may need to be removed. Damage to kidney blood vessels can lead to hypertension[1].\n\n4. **Specific Complications by Surgical Approach**:\n   - **Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy**:\n     - Complications include hemorrhage, bleeding (3-4%), hematoma, wound and local infection, abscess, urinary tract infection, adjacent organ injuries, ileus, and atelectasis[2, 3].\n     - Conversion to open surgery is a risk factor for complications, especially in patients with pheochromocytoma or larger tumors[3].\n   - **Robotic Adrenalectomy**:\n     - Similar complications to laparoscopic adrenalectomy, with the added benefit of reduced hospital stay and lower blood loss, but longer operative times[2].\n     - Specific risks include incisional hernia (2.6%), fever, and pleural effusion[2].\n\n5. **Patient-Specific Risk Factors**:\n   - **Comorbidities**: Patients with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, diabetes, and certain tumor types (e.g., pheochromocytoma) are at increased risk for complications[3].\n   - **Tumor size**: Tumors larger than 6 cm are associated with higher complication rates[3].\n\n6. **Postoperative Care**:\n   - **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for signs of complications such as fever, bleeding, increasing belly swelling, pain not controlled by medication, and difficulty breathing is crucial[4, 5].\n   - **Medication**: Patients may need medication to manage blood pressure, potassium levels, or to replace cortisol, especially if they had Cushing\'s Syndrome[4, 5].\n\nOverall, while adrenalectomy is generally a safe procedure, understanding the potential complications and risk factors is essential for optimal patient care and management.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://www.umms.org/ummc/health-services/surgery/endocrine-surgery/conditions/adrenal-gland/risks\n[2] https://gs.amegroups.org/article/view/40821/html\n[3] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2695520\n[4] https://www.sages.org/publications/patient-information/adrenal-gland-removal-adrenalectomy-patient-information-from-sages/\n[5] https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/surgery/adrenalectomy\n'","'Adrenalectomy, the surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands, can be performed through open, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches.

Here are some of the key complications associated with hysterectomy:\n\n1. **General Anaesthetic Complications**:\n   - Nerve damage, allergic reactions, and death are rare but possible complications of general anesthesia[1].\n\n2. **Bleeding**:\n   - Heavy bleeding (haemorrhage) can occur, sometimes requiring blood transfusions. The risk of bleeding is higher in certain cases, such as peripartum hysterectomy or hysterectomy for gynecologic cancer[1, 4].\n\n3. **Ureter Damage**:\n   - The ureter can be damaged during surgery, which may require repair during the procedure. This is a rare complication but can lead to urinary incontinence and other urinary problems[1, 4].\n\n4. **Bladder or Bowel Damage**:\n   - Damage to the bladder or bowel can occur, leading to infections, incontinence, and the need for temporary catheters or colostomies. These injuries are more common in laparoscopic procedures[1, 2, 4].\n\n5. **Infection**:\n   - Postoperative infections, including wound infections and urinary tract infections, can occur. The risk of infection is higher without proper antibiotic prophylaxis and varies by surgical route (abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic)[1, 2, 3].\n\n6. **Blood Clots**:\n   - Venous thromboembolism (blood clots) can form, especially after periods of immobility. Anticoagulant medications may be given to reduce this risk[1, 2].\n\n7. **Vaginal Problems**:\n   - Vaginal cuff dehiscence (opening of the vaginal cuff) can occur, leading to complications such as bowel evisceration, infection, and pelvic pressure. This is more common after laparoscopic hysterectomy[2, 3].\n\n8. **Ovary Failure**:\n   - Even if the ovaries are left intact, there can be early menopause symptoms due to reduced estrogen levels. This is particularly a concern for women under 40, as it can increase the risk of osteoporosis[1].\n\n9. **Early Menopause**:\n   - If the ovaries are removed, menopausal symptoms can start immediately, including hot flushes, sweating, vaginal dryness, and disturbed sleep[1].\n\n10. **Long-Term Complications**:\n    - Vaginal vault prolapse, where the top of the vagina loses support and sags into the vaginal canal, can occur.

208,surgery complications of mammogram,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Surgery complications related to mammograms primarily concern women who have undergone breast surgery, including those with breast implants, breast lifts, breast reductions, and those who have had breast cancer surgery. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Breast Implants**:\n   - **Rupture**: Breast implants can rupture during mammographic compression. This risk is present for both silicone gel-filled and saline-filled implants[1, 2].\n   - **Interference with Imaging**: Breast implants can obscure breast tissue, making it harder to detect abnormalities. Special techniques, such as implant displacement views, are used to maximize breast tissue visualization[1, 3].\n   - **Pain and Swelling**: Women with breast implants may experience pain and swelling during mammography[1, 2].\n\n2. **Breast Lifts**:\n   - **Baseline Mammograms**: After a breast lift, a new baseline mammogram is recommended about six months after surgery to account for changes in breast shape and potential scar tissue[3].\n   - **Compression**: The mammography compression machine will not undo the lift or cause the breasts to sag, but it is essential to inform the mammography technician about the surgery[3].\n\n3. **Breast Reductions**:\n   - **New Baseline**: Similar to breast lifts, a new baseline mammogram is recommended six months after breast reduction surgery to account for changes in breast tissue and potential scar tissue[3].\n   - **Unnecessary Mammograms**: Younger women without a known cancer risk often receive unnecessary mammograms before breast reduction surgery, which can lead to additional tests and invasive procedures[5].\n\n4. **Breast Cancer Surgery**:\n   - **Type of Surgery**: The type of breast cancer surgery affects whether future mammograms are needed. Women who have had breast-conserving surgery (BCS) will still need mammograms, while those who have had a mastectomy typically do not need mammograms on the affected side[4].\n   - **Baseline Mammograms**: After BCS, a new baseline mammogram is recommended 6 to 12 months after radiation treatment ends to monitor for changes and signs of recurrence[4].\n   - **Reconstructed Breasts**: Women with reconstructed breasts after mastectomy do not need routine mammograms on the affected side, but may need diagnostic mammograms and ultrasounds if an area of concern is found during a physical exam[4].\n\nIn summary, breast surgery can complicate mammograms by altering breast tissue and potentially obscuring abnormalities.

These complications can arise from the surgical procedure itself, the implant used, or the patient's health and lifestyle factors. Here are some of the common and serious complications associated with knee implants:\n\n### Common Complications:\n1. **Pain and Stiffness**: Persistent pain and stiffness are common issues after knee replacement surgery. These symptoms can be due to various factors, including improper implant alignment, infection, or excessive scar tissue formation[1, 5].\n\n2. **Loosening**: Over time, the implant can loosen, which may require revision surgery. This can be caused by infection, wear and tear, or aseptic loosening, where the bone around the implant deteriorates without infection[1, 4].\n\n3. **Infection**: Infection is a serious complication that can occur after knee replacement surgery. It may require antibiotics, and in severe cases, surgical removal of the infected implant and surrounding tissue[1, 2, 5].\n\n4. **Blood Clots**: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are potential complications. DVT can occur in the legs, and if a clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, it can cause a life-threatening PE[2, 3, 4].\n\n5. **Nerve Damage**: Nerve damage during surgery can lead to numbness, weakness, and pain. In some cases, additional procedures may be needed to address these issues[1, 3, 5].\n\n### Serious Complications:\n1. **Fractures**: Fractures of the femur, tibia, or patella can occur after knee replacement surgery, often requiring revision surgery[1].\n\n2. **Implant Failure**: Implant failure can result from various factors, including infection, instability, or aseptic loosening. This usually necessitates a second surgery to replace the failed implant[1, 5].\n\n3. **Allergic Reactions**: Some patients may experience allergic reactions or metal hypersensitivity to the materials used in the implant, such as chromium, nickel, or cobalt[3].\n\n4. **Heart Attack and Stroke**: Although rare, these serious complications can occur due to the stress of surgery and anesthesia[1].\n\n### Preventive Measures:\n- **Early Movement**: Encouraging early movement and using compression stockings can help prevent blood clots[4].\n- **Antibiotics**: Prescribing antibiotics before, during, and after surgery can reduce the risk of infection[3].\n- **Physical Therapy**: Regular physical therapy can help prevent stiffness and improve knee function[5].\n\nIt is essential for patients to discuss these potential complications with their healthcare provider and follow post-surgical care instructions to minimize risks.

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Wear and Debris**:\n   - **Metal Debris**: The grinding of metal components in MoM implants releases metal ions (cobalt and chromium) into the body, leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and bone erosion[2, 5].\n   - **Systemic Effects**: Metal ions can cause systemic problems, including kidney issues, liver issues, eye issues, and even neurological difficulties[1, 2].\n\n2. **Local Tissue Reactions**:\n   - **Adverse Local Tissue Reactions (ALTRs)**: These reactions can range from mild inflammation to severe tissue destruction, including pseudotumors and bone resorption[4, 5].\n   - **Pseudotumors**: These are tumor-like masses that can form around the implant, causing pain and dysfunction[1, 4].\n\n3. **Revision Surgery**:\n   - **High Failure Rate**: MoM implants have a higher failure rate compared to other types of hip implants, often requiring revision surgery[2, 5].\n   - **Complications**: Revision surgery can be riskier and less successful due to bone loss and tissue damage from the original implant[2, 3].\n\n4. **Metallosis**:\n   - **Definition**: Metallosis is a condition where metal debris accumulates in the body's soft tissues, causing tissue death and damage[3].\n   - **Symptoms**: Symptoms can include pain, loss of mobility, metallic taste, nausea, shortness of breath, hearing loss, and vision problems[3].\n   - **Treatment**: The only treatment for metallosis is to remove and replace the metal parts through revision surgery[3].\n\n5. **Systemic Health Impacts**:\n   - **Cardiovascular and Neurological Risks**: High levels of metal ions in the bloodstream have been associated with cardiovascular disease, neurological difficulties, and other systemic health problems[2, 3].\n\n6. **Monitoring and Testing**:\n   - **Blood Tests**: Regular blood tests are recommended to monitor metal ion levels in patients with MoM implants[2, 5].\n   - **MRI**: An MRI may be necessary to assess fluid accumulation around the joint and potential tissue damage[2, 5].\n\nOverall, metal hip implants can lead to significant complications, emphasizing the importance of careful monitoring and timely intervention to prevent long-term damage.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://thescopeboston.org/7401/news-and-features/features/years-after-procedure-metal-hip-replacement-surgeries-continue-to-wreak-havoc-on-the-lives-of-patients/\n[2] https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/joint-surgery/safety-and-risks/metal-on-metal-hip-implant-risks\n[3] https://www.mctlaw.com/joint-replacement/metallosis-metal-hip/\n[4] https://aoj.amegroups.org/article/view/5437/html\n[5] https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/metal-metal-hip-implants/concerns-about-metal-metal-hip-implants\n""","""Surgery complications of metal hip implants, particularly metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants, can be severe and varied.

252,common complications of ileostomy,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Common complications of an ileostomy can be categorized into early and late complications. Here are some of the most frequently encountered issues:\n\n1. **Skin Irritation and Problems**:\n   - **Skin Irritation**: This is the most common early complication, causing itching, sores, and infections around the stoma site. Proper care and cleaning can help prevent these issues[1, 3].\n   - **Skin Damage**: Skin damage around the stoma can occur due to improper stoma bag fit, leading to discomfort and leakage[2, 3].\n\n2. **Dehydration**:\n   - **Dehydration**: Since the large intestine is either removed or unused, it can no longer absorb water from food waste, making dehydration a common complication. Drinking extra fluids is essential to prevent dehydration[2, 3, 5].\n\n3. **Bowel Obstruction**:\n   - **Bowel Blockage**: Obstruction can occur if the stoma becomes blocked, preventing waste and gas from passing through. Symptoms include abdominal swelling, pain, nausea, and vomiting. Immediate medical attention is necessary if the stoma is inactive for more than 12 hours[2, 3, 5].\n\n4. **Stoma Complications**:\n   - **Stoma Retraction**: The stoma can retract into the abdomen, causing leakage and skin irritation. This can be managed with convex wafers or ostomy belts[1, 3].\n   - **Stoma Prolapse**: The stoma can protrude too far, leading to abrasions, infections, and other complications. This can be caused by rapid weight gain, weak abdominal walls, pregnancy, or abdominal pressure[1, 3].\n   - **Parastomal Hernia**: A hernia can occur around the stoma site, causing swelling and discomfort. This may require surgical intervention[1, 2].\n\n5. **Infection**:\n   - **Infection**: The wound around the ileostomy can become infected, requiring antibiotic treatment. Signs of infection include high temperature, shivering, and redness around the stoma[2, 5].\n\n6. **Nutritional Deficiencies**:\n   - **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: The removal of part of the intestine can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, causing symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and neurological problems. Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor vitamin B12 levels[5].\n\nUnderstanding these complications and seeking prompt medical attention if symptoms arise is crucial for managing an ileostomy effectively.

Here are some of the most frequently encountered problems:\n\n1. **Infections**:\n   - **Urinary Tract Infections**: Bacteria can enter the urine from the stoma or ileum, leading to infections. Symptoms include fever, pain around the kidneys, and changes in urine output[2, 4].\n   - **Stoma Infections**: Infections can occur at the stoma site, causing redness, swelling, and discharge[1, 3].\n\n2. **Bleeding**:\n   - **Bleeding from the Stoma**: Minor bleeding is common due to delicate blood vessels, but excessive bleeding or bleeding from inside the stoma requires immediate medical attention[2, 5].\n   - **Bleeding and Discharge from the Urethra**: In cases where the bladder is left in place, bleeding or discharge from the urethra can occur and may require antibiotics or further surgical intervention[5].\n\n3. **Skin Complications**:\n   - **Irritation and Soreness**: The skin around the stoma can become irritated or sore due to an ill-fitting urostomy pouch, pre-existing skin conditions, or frequent removal of the pouch[2, 3].\n   - **Leaks**: Frequent leaks from the urostomy pouch can cause skin irritation and require adjustments to the pouch or consultation with a stoma nurse[5].\n\n4. **Hernias**:\n   - **Stoma Hernias**: Hernias can occur at the stoma site when bowel or fatty tissue pushes through a weak area in the abdominal wall. This may require surgical repair or the use of a support belt[2, 5].\n\n5. **Stoma Complications**:\n   - **Stoma Prolapse**: Part of the intestine can push through the stoma, potentially causing blockages or loss of blood supply[1].\n   - **Stoma Retraction**: The stoma can sink below the level of the skin, making it difficult to manage[1].\n\n6. **Metabolic and Nutritional Issues**:\n   - **Metabolic Acidosis**: The body can become too acidic due to the use of bowel tissue in urinary diversion[4].\n   - **Vitamin Deficiencies**: The loss of bowel tissue can lead to difficulties in absorbing vitamins, such as vitamin B12[4].\n\n7. **Long-term Complications**:\n   - **Kidney Problems**: Backflow of urine into the kidneys can cause infections, hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidney), and decreased kidney function[4].\n   - **Bowel Changes**: The use of bowel tissue in urinary diversion can lead to chronic bowel issues, including diarrhea, incontinence, and difficulties in digesting fats[4].\n\nIt is essential to monitor for these complications and seek medical help promptly if any unusual symptoms or problems arise after urostomy surgery.

261,common complications of urostomy,12/19/2024,aio,"""Urostomy complications can occur after surgery to create a new opening (stoma) in the abdomen for urine to drain. These complications can include: [1, 2, 3]  \n\nEarly Complications (within 30 days): [1, 3]  \n\n\n\n- Infection: This is the most common complication, occurring in about 5-10% of cases. Symptoms include fever, pain, redness, and swelling around the stoma. [1, 3]  \n\n- Bleeding: Excessive bleeding from the stoma can occur in up to 5% of cases. [1]  \n\n- Stenosis (narrowing): The stoma may become narrow, making it difficult for urine to drain. [4, 5]  \n\n- Stones: Kidney stones can form in the urinary tract above the stoma. [6]  \n\n\n\nLate Complications (after 30 days): [7]  \n\n\n\n- Urinary tract infection (UTI): UTIs are still possible after a urostomy, although they are less common than before surgery. [8, 9, 10]  \n\n- Metabolic problems: Changes in electrolyte balance and vitamin B12 levels can occur. [11, 12, 13]  \n\n- Skin irritation: The skin around the stoma can become irritated and inflamed. [4]  \n\n- Herniation: A hernia can develop when part of the intestine pushes through the opening in the abdominal wall. [14, 15]  \n\n- Bowel obstruction: Scar tissue or adhesions can block the bowel, leading to constipation or abdominal pain. [16, 17, 18]  \n\n- Cancer: In rare cases, cancer may develop in the urinary tract or the stoma itself. [19, 20]  \n\n\n\nOther Potential Complications: [21]  \n\n\n\n- Allergies: To the adhesive or skin barrier used on the stoma. [21]  \n\n- Psychological distress: Adjusting to a urostomy can be emotionally challenging.

These complications can include: [1, 2, 3]  \n\nEarly Complications (within 30 days): [1, 3]  \n\n\n\n- Infection: This is the most common complication, occurring in about 5-10% of cases. Symptoms include fever, pain, redness, and swelling around the stoma. [1, 3]  \n\n- Bleeding: Excessive bleeding from the stoma can occur in up to 5% of cases. [1]  \n\n- Stenosis (narrowing): The stoma may become narrow, making it difficult for urine to drain. [4, 5]  \n\n- Stones: Kidney stones can form in the urinary tract above the stoma. [6]  \n\n\n\nLate Complications (after 30 days): [7]  \n\n\n\n- Urinary tract infection (UTI): UTIs are still possible after a urostomy, although they are less common than before surgery. [8, 9, 10]  \n\n- Metabolic problems: Changes in electrolyte balance and vitamin B12 levels can occur. [11, 12, 13]  \n\n- Skin irritation: The skin around the stoma can become irritated and inflamed. [4]  \n\n- Herniation: A hernia can develop when part of the intestine pushes through the opening in the abdominal wall. [14, 15]  \n\n- Bowel obstruction: Scar tissue or adhesions can block the bowel, leading to constipation or abdominal pain. [16, 17, 18]  \n\n- Cancer: In rare cases, cancer may develop in the urinary tract or the stoma itself. [19, 20]  \n\n\n\nOther Potential Complications: [21]  \n\n\n\n- Allergies: To the adhesive or skin barrier used on the stoma. [21]  \n\n- Psychological distress: Adjusting to a urostomy can be emotionally challenging.

280,common complications of kidney transplant,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Kidney transplant complications can be categorized into immediate post-surgical issues and long-term side effects. Here are some common complications:\n\n### Immediate Post-Surgical Complications:\n1. **Delayed Graft Function (Acute Tubular Necrosis):** The transplanted kidney may not function immediately, requiring temporary dialysis. This can be due to factors such as low blood pressure during CPR, prolonged storage of the kidney, or unexpected bleeding during surgery[1, 2].\n\n2. **Primary Non-Function:** Rarely, the transplanted kidney may never start working, necessitating its removal and potentially leading to a need for re-transplantation[1].\n\n3. **Infection:** Transplant recipients are at increased risk of infections due to immunosuppressive medications. Common infections include bacterial, viral (e.g., herpes group), and fungal infections (e.g., Candida, Pneumocystis carinii)[2, 3].\n\n4. **Urine Leak:** The ureter can detach from the bladder, causing urine to leak into the surrounding area, which requires surgical repair[1, 4].\n\n5. **Blood Clots and Bleeding:** These can occur during or after surgery and may require additional surgical intervention[4, 5].\n\n### Long-Term Complications:\n1. **Rejection Episodes:** The immune system may attack the transplanted kidney, leading to decreased function. Regular medication and monitoring are crucial to prevent and manage rejection[3, 4].\n\n2. **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):** This is a common complication, particularly in the early months after transplantation, and can be a side effect of immunosuppressive drugs. It increases the risk of heart disease and stroke[2, 3].\n\n3. **Diabetes Mellitus:** Some immunosuppressive medications can cause diabetes, which may require dietary changes, exercise, or specific medications[2, 3].\n\n4. **Cancer:** Transplant patients are at increased risk of certain cancers, such as lymphoma, skin cancer, and cervical cancer, due to immunosuppression[2, 4].\n\n5. **Medication Side Effects:** Other complications include osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, and various other side effects related to immunosuppressive medications[3, 4].\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Dehydration:** Restricting fluid intake can lead to dehydration, especially in hot weather, which can cause creatinine levels to rise[1].\n- **Heart Disease:** High blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart disease[2, 3].\n- **Nerve Damage:** This can occur in a small percentage of patients[5].\n\nRegular follow-up appointments and adherence to medication regimens are essential to manage and prevent these complications.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://health.ucdavis.edu/transplant/about/potential-complications-after-transplant-surgery.html\n[2] http://www.beaumont.ie/kidneycentre-forpatients-aguide-complications\n[3] https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/k/kidney-transplant-complications\n[4] https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777\n[5] https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/organ-transplantation/kidney/benefits-and-risks-of-a-kidney-transplant/risks-of-a-kidney-transplant/early-risks-of-a-kidney-transplant/\n'","'Kidney transplant complications can be categorized into immediate post-surgical issues and long-term side effects.

These can include bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, which are more likely due to the immunosuppressed state[2, 4, 5].\n\n3. **Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy (CAV)**:\n   - This is a form of coronary artery disease that can occur in the transplanted heart, leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death[1, 2, 4].\n\n4. **High Blood Pressure**:\n   - Hypertension is a common complication, occurring in 70% to 90% of patients treated with cyclosporine and 30% to 50% of those treated with tacrolimus[3, 4].\n\n5. **Diabetes**:\n   - New-onset diabetes can occur due to the immunosuppressive medications, particularly those like cyclosporine and tacrolimus[3, 5].\n\n6. **Kidney Failure**:\n   - The immunosuppressive drugs can also cause kidney damage, leading to chronic kidney disease or failure[1, 3].\n\n7. **Cancer**:\n   - There is an increased risk of certain cancers, such as skin cancer and lymphomas, due to the immunosuppressed state. Regular screening and monitoring are essential[1, 3, 4].\n\n8. **Primary Graft Failure**:\n   - This is a condition where the donor heart does not function properly after the transplant, which can be life-threatening[1].\n\n9. **Valvular Problems**:\n   - Issues like tricuspid regurgitation can occur, especially in the early period after the transplant[3].\n\n10. **Other Complications**:\n    - These include arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and other systemic issues like gout and osteoporosis[3, 5].\n\nRegular follow-up with healthcare providers, adherence to medication regimens, and a healthy lifestyle are crucial in managing these complications and ensuring the best possible outcomes after a heart transplant.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750\n[2] https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/heart-transplant\n[3] https://www.ccjm.org/content/ccjom/67/9/673.full.pdf\n[4] https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/organ-transplantation/heart/benefits-and-risks-of-a-heart-transplant/risks-of-a-heart-transplant/longer-term-risks-of-a-heart-transplant/\n[5] https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/h/heart-transplant/complications.html\n'","'Common complications of heart transplants include a variety of short-term and long-term risks.

Saline-filled implants can deflate, while silicone gel-filled implants may rupture silently without immediate symptoms[1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)**: This is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that can develop in the scar tissue around the implant. It is more commonly associated with textured surface implants[1, 3, 5].\n\n4. **Pain and Changes in Sensation**: Patients may experience breast pain, changes in nipple and breast sensation, and other discomforts[1, 2, 3].\n\n5. **Infection and Hematoma**: Infections, bleeding, and hematoma (blood accumulation) can occur after surgery[2, 4, 5].\n\n6. **Systemic Symptoms**: Some patients report systemic symptoms such as joint pain, muscle aches, confusion, chronic fatigue, and autoimmune diseases, often referred to as Breast Implant Illness (BII)[3, 5].\n\n7. **Additional Surgeries**: Many patients require additional surgeries due to complications, dissatisfaction with implant size or shape, or to treat adverse events[1, 2, 3].\n\n8. **Incorrect Positioning and Poor Scarring**: Implants can be incorrectly positioned, and poor scarring can occur, leading to aesthetic issues[2, 5].\n\n9. **Fluid Accumulation (Seroma)**: Fluid can accumulate around the implant, causing swelling and discomfort[5].\n\n10. **Wrinkling of Skin**: The skin over the implant can wrinkle, affecting the appearance of the breast[5].\n\nIt is essential for individuals considering breast implants to discuss these risks and benefits with their healthcare provider to make an informed decision.\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1] https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/breast-implants/risks-and-complications-breast-implants\n[2] https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medical-devices/breast-implants/risks.html\n[3] https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-know-about-breast-implants\n[4] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9041097/\n[5] https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/breast-augmentation/safety\n""","""Common complications of breast implants include a variety of issues that can arise both immediately after surgery and over the long term.
