Adrenal fatigue,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Adrenal fatigue is a term used to describe a collection of symptoms such as fatigue, body aches, and digestive issues, often attributed to chronic stress and the supposed depletion of adrenal hormones, particularly cortisol and DHEA. However, it is not a recognized medical condition by mainstream medical communities due to a lack of scientific evidence supporting its existence.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Definition and Symptoms**: Adrenal fatigue is characterized by symptoms like morning fatigue, difficulty waking up, afternoon lows, salt and sugar cravings, severe premenstrual symptoms, frequent allergies, constipation, depression, and difficulty losing weight despite dieting[2, 5].\n\n2. **Cortisol and DHEA**: The two main hormones associated with adrenal fatigue are cortisol, a stress hormone, and DHEA, an anti-stress hormone. Maintaining a balanced ratio between these hormones is crucial for combating adrenal fatigue[2].\n\n3. **Lack of Scientific Evidence**: Despite its popularity, adrenal fatigue is not recognized as a medical condition by many health organizations. Studies have failed to prove its existence, and there is no formal criteria for diagnosing it[4, 5].\n\n4. **Distinguishing from Adrenal Insufficiency**: Adrenal insufficiency (Addisonâ€™s disease) is a recognized medical condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. It has distinct symptoms such as chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and abdominal pain, which are different from those attributed to adrenal fatigue[3, 5].\n\n5. **Treatment**: While adrenal fatigue is not a recognized condition, treatments often focus on lifestyle changes such as getting good sleep, eating a healthy diet, exercising moderately, reducing stress, and possibly taking certain supplements like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, and vitamins[2, 5].\n\n### Conclusion:\nAdrenal fatigue is a controversial term that describes a set of symptoms often linked to chronic stress. However, it lacks scientific backing and is not recognized as a medical condition. If you experience symptoms similar to those described as adrenal fatigue, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out other potential causes and to discuss appropriate treatments.\n\n### References:\n- **WebMD**: Adrenal Fatigue: Is It Real?

Chronic Lyme disease,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Chronic Lyme disease (CLD) is a term that has been used to describe a variety of symptoms that some people experience after being treated for Lyme disease, a bacterial infection caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*. However, the term CLD is controversial and not universally accepted by medical professionals due to its lack of a clear clinical definition and the fact that many people who claim to have CLD have no evidence of a current or past infection with *B. burgdorferi*.\n\nKey points about chronic Lyme disease include:\n\n1. **Definition and Controversy**:\n   - The term CLD is often used to describe non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, and cognitive dysfunction, even if there is no evidence of Lyme disease[1, 2].\n   - Medical professionals generally reject the label and the belief that these symptoms are caused by persistent Lyme infection[2].\n\n2. **Distinction from Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)**:\n   - PTLDS is a recognized condition where symptoms persist after successful antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease. It is distinct from CLD and occurs in less than 5% of people treated for Lyme disease[1, 2].\n   - Unlike CLD, PTLDS is a well-defined condition with a clear link to Lyme disease treatment.\n\n3. **Treatment and Risks**:\n   - Long-term antibiotic therapy is not recommended for CLD as it is ineffective and potentially harmful[1, 2].\n   - Randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that antibiotics offer no sustained benefit in people with CLD, with evidence of both placebo effects and significant adverse effects from such treatment[2].\n\n4. **Alternative Explanations**:\n   - Many symptoms attributed to CLD are likely due to other conditions such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome, which can be triggered by infections but are not effectively treated with antibiotics[2].\n\n5. **Impact on Quality of Life**:\n   - Patients who believe they have CLD often report severe symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life, including high disability and unemployment rates[3].\n\nIn summary, chronic Lyme disease is a controversial term that is not universally accepted by medical professionals.

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is a condition where individuals report a variety of symptoms that they attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from sources such as cell phones, Wi-Fi, and other electronic devices.

Multiple chemical sensitivity,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a condition where individuals experience a wide range of symptoms that they attribute to exposure to low levels of commonly used chemicals. Here are some key points about MCS:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: Symptoms of MCS are diverse and non-specific, including fatigue, headaches, nausea, respiratory problems, dizziness, confusion, muscle and joint pain, skin rashes, and more[1, 2, 3].\n\n2. **Triggers**: Triggers can include a variety of chemicals found in everyday products such as perfumes, cleaning products, new carpet, chlorine, and auto exhaust[1, 3, 5].\n\n3. **Recognition**: MCS is not universally recognized as a medical condition. The American Medical Association and other professional organizations do not consider it an illness, and there is ongoing debate among healthcare providers about its status[1, 3, 5].\n\n4. **Causes**: The exact cause of MCS is unclear. Some theories suggest it could be an immune response, a neurological condition, or related to psychological factors such as anxiety and depression[2, 3].\n\n5. **Diagnosis and Treatment**: There are no reliable tests to diagnose MCS, and there are no proven treatments. Healthcare providers often focus on managing specific symptoms and may recommend avoiding known triggers[1, 3, 5].\n\n6. **Management**: People with MCS often find relief by identifying and avoiding triggers, and some may benefit from treatments for anxiety, sleep issues, and specific symptoms like headaches. Cognitive behavioral therapy and desensitization may also be helpful[1, 5].\n\n7. **Research**: Research into MCS is limited, and there is a need for more rigorous, peer-reviewed studies to understand the condition better[2, 4].\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n- **Seek Professional Help**: Consult with a healthcare provider who is knowledgeable about MCS and willing to work with you to manage symptoms.\n- **Avoid Unproven Treatments**: Be cautious of expensive, unproven tests or treatments that could cause harm.\n- **Identify Triggers**: Try to identify and avoid specific chemicals that trigger your symptoms.\n- **Stay Informed**: Keep up with the latest research and recommendations from reputable sources.\n\n### References:\n1. **WebMD**: https://www.webmd.com/allergies/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n2. **Wikipedia**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity\n3. **Johns Hopkins Medicine**: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n4. **Mass.gov**: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n5. **Cleveland Clinic**: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n\n\nGenerative AI is experimental.\n\n\n[1]Â\xa0https://www.webmd.com/allergies/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n[2]Â\xa0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_chemical_sensitivity\n[3]Â\xa0https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n[4]Â\xa0https://www.mass.gov/info-details/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n[5]Â\xa0https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/multiple-chemical-sensitivity\n'","'Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a condition where individuals experience a wide range of symptoms that they attribute to exposure to low levels of commonly used chemicals.

Rope worms,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Rope worms are structures that have been found in the intestines and are often described as long, rope-like entities. However, there is significant debate and controversy regarding their nature and classification.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Discovery and Appearance**: Rope worms were first reported in 2009 during colon cleansing procedures such as coffee enemas. They are described as being over a meter long, slimy, and resembling twisted fibers of rope attached to the intestinal wall[1, 2].\n\n2. **Theories on Nature**: There are two main theories about rope worms:\n   - **Parasitic Theory**: Some researchers suggest that rope worms are parasitic worms that live anaerobically in the human gastrointestinal tract. They propose that these worms have five distinct developmental stages, starting as slimy mucus and evolving into a viscous mucus rope[1, 2].\n   - **Intestinal Debris Theory**: The majority of the scientific community believes that rope worms are not parasites but rather a buildup of intestinal mucus and other debris. This theory is supported by the fact that the DNA found in rope worms is primarily human DNA, along with some bacterial DNA[3, 4].\n\n3. **Clinical Symptoms**: Symptoms associated with rope worms include abdominal pain, bloating, gases, indigestion, constipation, and intestinal obstruction. However, these symptoms are non-specific and can be caused by various conditions[1, 2].\n\n4. **Treatment**: There is no standard treatment for rope worms due to the lack of scientific consensus on their nature. Some proponents of the parasitic theory suggest using enemas with eucalyptus and lemon juice to remove the worms, while others recommend antiparasitic medications like albendazole, though these treatments have shown no improvement in symptoms[1, 2, 3].\n\n5. **Scientific Consensus**: The scientific community generally views rope worms as pseudoscientific, with most evidence suggesting they are not actual parasites but rather misidentified intestinal artifacts or mucoid plaques[4, 5].\n\nIn summary, while some researchers propose that rope worms are parasitic, the prevailing scientific view is that they are not actual parasites but rather a misidentification of intestinal mucus and debris.

Rope worms,12/19/2024,aio,"'""Rope worms"" is a non-medical term used to describe long, thin, worm-like structures that may be seen in the stool or other bodily fluids. \n\nScientific Evidence: [1]  \n\nThere is no scientific evidence to support the existence of rope worms as a distinct medical condition or parasite. [2]  \n\nPossible Explanations: [3]  \n\n\n\nâ€¢ Intestinal mucus: Mucus produced in the intestines can sometimes form long, rope-like strands. [4]  \n\nâ€¢ Threadworms: These are real parasites that can appear as thin, white threads in the stool. [5]  \n\nâ€¢ Undigested food: Certain foods, such as asparagus or rice noodles, can be mistaken for rope worms. [6]  \n\nâ€¢ Artifacts: In some cases, rope worms may be artifacts caused by laboratory procedures or sample preparation. [7]  \n\n\n\nMedical Concerns: [8]  \n\nIf you see rope worms in your stool, it is generally not a cause for concern. However, it is important to consult a healthcare professional if you experience any other symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting.

Shoenfeld's syndrome,1/2/2025,perplexity,"""Shoenfeld's syndrome, also known as Autoimmune/Inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants (ASIA), is a hypothesized autoimmune disorder proposed by Israeli immunologist Yehuda Shoenfeld in 2011. Here are some key points about ASIA:\n\n1. **Definition and Causes**: ASIA is believed to be triggered by exposure to adjuvants, which are substances that enhance the immune response. These adjuvants include aluminum salts in vaccines, silicone in breast implants, and other environmental immune stimulators[1, 2].\n\n2. **Clinical Features**: The syndrome encompasses a wide spectrum of symptoms and immunological features, including post-vaccination symptoms, macrophagic myofasciitis, Gulf War syndrome, sick building syndrome, siliconosis, and potentially SjÃ¶gren's syndrome[1, 3].\n\n3. **Evidence and Controversy**: The existence of ASIA is controversial. While some studies suggest a link between adjuvants and autoimmune diseases, others have found no evidence to support this theory. A study of 18,000 people showed no merit to the theory of ASIA, and other studies have found that patients receiving injected aluminum adjuvants had a lower incidence of autoimmune disease compared to controls[1, 5].\n\n4. **Case Reports and Associations**: Some case reports have identified associations between ASIA and autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, systemic sclerosis, and SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome, particularly in individuals with silicone breast implants (SBI)[3, 4].\n\n5. **Severe Manifestations**: Severe cases of ASIA have been reported, including major organ involvement, life-threatening conditions, and even death. These cases have been linked to various adjuvants, including HPV vaccines, silicone, and influenza vaccines[4].\n\n6. **Current Understanding**: The current understanding of ASIA is that it may represent a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and immune responses. However, the scientific community remains divided on the validity of ASIA as a distinct syndrome[2, 5].\n\nIn summary, Shoenfeld's syndrome or ASIA is a controversial concept that proposes a link between adjuvants and autoimmune diseases.

vaccine overload,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'The concept of ""vaccine overload"" or ""immune overload"" refers to the concern that administering multiple vaccines simultaneously could overwhelm or weaken the immune system, particularly in infants and children. However, extensive scientific research and evidence from reputable sources indicate that this concern is not supported by empirical data.\n\nKey points from the available literature include:\n\n1. **Lack of Evidence for Overload**:\n   - The World Health Organization (WHO) and various studies have concluded that there is no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that vaccines, as currently used, weaken or harm the immune system[1, 5].\n   - Research has shown that infants have a significant capacity to respond to multiple vaccines without experiencing immune overload[2, 5].\n\n2. **Vaccine Interference vs. Overload**:\n   - While certain combinations of vaccines can interfere with each other (e.g., epitopic overload), this does not equate to immune overload but rather indicates a need for careful consideration in vaccine formulation[2].\n\n3. **Public Concerns**:\n   - Parental concerns about vaccine overload are common and can affect immunization programs.

[19, 20, 21]  \n\n\n\nConclusion: [22]  \n\nWhile some people report experiencing symptoms they attribute to wind turbines, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of wind turbine syndrome as a distinct medical condition. It is important to consider psychological factors and other potential causes of reported symptoms before drawing conclusions about their relationship to wind turbines.

Symptoms of Adrenal fatigue,1/2/2025,perplexity,"""The symptoms of adrenal fatigue, a condition not recognized by conventional medicine but often discussed in alternative health contexts, include:\n\n1. **Chronic Fatigue**: Feeling tired and exhausted even after a full night's sleep, and difficulty recovering from stress or illness[2, 3, 5].\n2. **Difficulty Handling Stress**: Reduced ability to cope with stress, feeling overwhelmed by situations that were previously manageable[2, 4].\n3. **Cravings**: Increased cravings for salty or sugary foods, as the body seeks to balance sodium levels and find quick energy sources[2, 3, 5].\n4. **Sleep Issues**: Trouble falling asleep and waking up, and sometimes experiencing higher energy levels in the evening[3, 4, 5].\n5. **Weight Changes**: Some sources mention weight gain, while others note that weight loss can also occur, though this symptom is more commonly associated with adrenal insufficiency[3, 5].\n6. **Mood Changes**: Symptoms like irritability, depression, and decreased libido can also be present, though these are also common in many other conditions[1, 4].\n\nIt's important to note that adrenal fatigue is not a recognized medical condition by mainstream medical organizations, and its symptoms can overlap with many other conditions such as depression, sleep apnea, and hypothyroidism.

These sores can leave hyperpigmented scars[1, 3, 4].\n   - **Fibers**: The presence of multicolored fibers (black, white, red, blue) under the skin or emerging from sores is a hallmark symptom[1, 3, 4].\n\n3. **Systemic Symptoms**:\n   - **Fatigue**: Extreme fatigue is often reported[1, 2, 5].\n   - **Joint and Muscle Pain**: Joint and muscle pain are common symptoms[1, 3, 5].\n   - **Neurological Issues**: Nervous system problems, including difficulty concentrating and memory problems, can occur[1, 3, 5].\n   - **Hair Loss**: Some patients experience hair loss[1].\n   - **Tooth Loss**: Tooth loss has been reported in some cases[1].\n   - **Sleep Problems**: Sleep disorders are also associated with Morgellons disease[1, 3].\n\n4. **Psychological Symptoms**:\n   - **Depression and Anxiety**: Depression and anxiety are often seen in individuals with Morgellons disease[2, 4, 5].\n   - **Delusional Parasitosis**: Some patients may have delusional beliefs about parasites infesting their skin, which can lead to repeated scratching and picking, resulting in self-inflicted skin sores[2, 5].\n\nIt's important to note that Morgellons disease is a controversial and poorly understood condition, with ongoing debate about its nature and causes.

Symptoms of Rope worms,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Rope worms are long, rope-like structures that can occur in the intestines and are often associated with various symptoms. The primary symptoms of rope worm infections include:\n\n1. **Abdominal Pain**: Patients often experience vague abdominal pain, which can be persistent and uncomfortable[1, 3].\n2. **Bloating and Gases**: Bloating and gas in the abdomen are common symptoms, contributing to discomfort and digestive issues[1, 3].\n3. **Indigestion**: Indigestion is another symptom that can be caused by the presence of rope worms in the intestines[1, 3].\n4. **Constipation**: Constipation is a significant symptom, with patients often unable to pass stool without the aid of water or milk rectal enemas[1, 3].\n5. **Obstruction of the Intestine**: The rope worms can obstruct the intestine, leading to severe abdominal pain and other complications[1, 3].\n6. **Slimy Substances**: The worms produce slimy substances with a distinct and off-putting odor[1, 3].\n7. **Non-Specific Symptoms**: Other non-specific symptoms may include weight gain or loss, food allergies, common colds, coughing, back pain, rashes, headaches, and hair loss[1, 3].\n\nIt is important to note that the concept of rope worms as parasitic organisms is highly disputed, with some researchers suggesting that they may be nothing more than a buildup of intestinal mucus and debris rather than actual parasites[4, 5].

Symptoms of vaccine overload,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'The concept of ""vaccine overload"" is a common concern among parents, but it is not supported by scientific evidence. The idea that vaccines can overload a child\'s immune system is a misconception. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Immune System Capacity**:\n   - **Healthy Immune Response**: A healthy child\'s immune system is capable of handling multiple vaccines at once. The immune system is designed to fight off numerous pathogens daily, and vaccines introduce only a small fraction of antigens compared to what the body naturally encounters[4, 5].\n\n2. **Vaccine Safety**:\n   - **Rigorous Testing**: Vaccines undergo rigorous safety testing before they are approved for use. They are also continuously monitored for side effects after they are introduced[2, 5].\n   - **Mild Side Effects**: Most vaccine side effects are mild and temporary, such as soreness at the injection site, fever, and mild flu-like symptoms. These side effects typically resolve within a few days[1, 2, 5].\n\n3. **Common Misconceptions**:\n   - **No Overload**: There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that vaccines can overload a child\'s immune system. Studies have shown that the immune system can handle the antigens from multiple vaccines without adverse effects[3, 4].\n   - **No Link to Autism**: There is no link between vaccines and autism. Extensive research has consistently found no evidence to support this claim[2, 4, 5].\n\n4. **Benefits of Vaccination**:\n   - **Disease Prevention**: Vaccines are crucial for preventing infectious diseases that can cause serious illness and death. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks of mild side effects[2, 5].\n\nIn summary, the symptoms often associated with vaccines are mild and temporary, and there is no scientific basis for the concept of ""vaccine overload.""

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is a condition where individuals report a variety of symptoms that they believe are caused by exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from sources such as cell phones, Wi-Fi, and other electronic devices. Here are some key points about EHS symptoms:\n\n1. **Symptoms**: Common symptoms reported by individuals with EHS include headaches, fatigue, dizziness, skin problems (redness, tingling, burning), sleep disorders (insomnia), trouble concentrating, muscle and body pain, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and various neurological and psychiatric symptoms[1, 3, 5].\n\n2. **Variability**: Symptoms can vary widely among individuals and are not specific to EHS, often overlapping with other syndromes such as idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI) and functional somatic syndromes[2, 3].\n\n3. **Lack of Scientific Evidence**: Despite the reported symptoms, there is no strong scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that EMF exposure causes EHS. Double-blind studies have shown that individuals with EHS cannot accurately detect the presence of EMFs and are as likely to report symptoms following sham exposure as they are following genuine EMF exposure[2, 3, 5].\n\n4. **Psychological Factors**: The nocebo effect, where individuals experience adverse effects due to the belief that something is harmful, is suggested to play a role in EHS symptoms. Additionally, pre-existing psychiatric conditions and stress reactions to worrying about EMF health effects may contribute to the symptoms[2, 3, 5].\n\n5. **Environmental Factors**: Other environmental factors unrelated to EMFs, such as poor indoor air quality, excessive noise, flickering fluorescent lights, and glare from visual display units (VDUs), may also be responsible for some symptoms[3, 5].\n\n6. **Medical Approach**: While the symptoms are real and can be disabling, medical professionals focus on improving quality of life for those who believe they have EHS, including finding better ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent its symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy and management of comorbid psychiatric disorders may be helpful in managing the condition[1, 2].\n\n7. **Recommendations**: Individuals experiencing symptoms should seek medical advice from a qualified medical specialist. Organizations such as ARPANSA and the World Health Organization (WHO) continue to review research and provide accurate and up-to-date advice on potential health effects of EMF exposure[3, 5].\n\nIn summary, while EHS symptoms are real and can be disabling, there is no established scientific evidence that they are caused by EMF exposure at levels below current safety guidelines.

vaccine overload symptoms,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'The term ""vaccine overload"" is not a recognized medical condition, but it seems you might be referring to the common side effects experienced after vaccination, particularly with COVID-19 vaccines.

Studies have found that individuals who reported more symptoms, such as fatigue, malaise, chills, and headache, had higher levels of neutralizing antibodies (nAB) against SARS-CoV-2[1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Severity and Duration**: The severity and duration of side effects can vary. For example, some people may experience mild symptoms that last a day or two, while others may have more severe symptoms that last longer[2].\n\n4. **Biometric Measurements**: Studies using biometric devices to measure skin temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate have found correlations between these measurements and antibody levels. For instance, a 1Â°C increase in skin temperature after the second dose was associated with higher nAB levels[1, 3].\n\n5. **General Safety**: While side effects can be uncomfortable, they are generally mild and temporary. Severe allergic reactions are rare but can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention[5].\n\n6. **Vaccine Hesitancy**: Concerns about side effects are a common reason for vaccine hesitancy. However, it\'s important to remember that the potential complications of COVID-19 far outweigh the risks associated with vaccination[3].\n\nIn summary, experiencing symptoms after vaccination is a normal part of the immune response and does not indicate ""vaccine overload.""

Wind turbine syndrome,1/2/2025,perplexity,"'Wind turbine syndrome (WTS) is a term used to describe a set of symptoms allegedly caused by living near wind turbines. The symptoms include vertigo, nausea, tinnitus, sleep disturbances, headaches, and irritability, among others. However, the scientific consensus is that there is no evidence to support the existence of WTS as a medical condition caused by wind turbines.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Lack of Scientific Evidence:**\n   - Numerous studies have found no evidence that wind turbines cause health problems through infrasound or low-frequency noise[2, 4].\n   - A comprehensive study by the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research concluded that infrasound from wind turbines does not cause health issues such as dizziness, nausea, or sleep disturbances[2].\n\n2. **Nocebo Effect:**\n   - The symptoms reported by individuals living near wind turbines are often attributed to the nocebo effect, where the belief that wind turbines are harmful leads to perceived health issues[2, 4].\n\n3. **Scientific Reviews:**\n   - Since 2003, 25 reviews of the scientific literature on wind turbines and health have consistently found no reason to believe that wind turbines are harmful to health[4].\n   - Expert panels and studies have concluded that there is no association between wind turbine noise and psychological distress or mental health problems[4].\n\n4. **Controversy and Misinformation:**\n   - The concept of WTS has been promoted by certain groups and individuals, despite the lack of scientific evidence[3, 4].\n   - The Waubra Foundation, an Australian anti-wind farm group, has been involved in promoting the idea of WTS and was stripped of its status as a health promotion charity due to its activities[4].\n\n5. **Legal Cases:**\n   - A French legal case recognized WTS as a real condition in 2021, but this decision is not supported by the broader scientific consensus[4].\n\nIn summary, while some individuals and groups claim that wind turbines cause health problems, the overwhelming scientific evidence does not support the existence of wind turbine syndrome as a medical condition caused by wind turbines.
