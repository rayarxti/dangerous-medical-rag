QUERY: do antibiotics cause colon cancer
DATE: 12-03-2024
Yes, antibiotics can increase the risk of colon cancer: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Risk increases with age
A Scottish study found that antibiotic use was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer across all ages, but the risk was almost 50% higher in people under 50. [4]
Risk increases with dose
The association between antibiotics and colon cancer is dose-dependent. [2]
Risk increases with type of antibiotic
Antibiotics that target anaerobic bacteria, such as penicillin and cephalosporin-based drugs, are associated with a higher risk. [2]
Risk increases with gut microbiome disruption
Antibiotics can impact the gut microbiome, a process known as dysbiosis. This imbalance can lead to an imbalance of immune system chemicals, which may lead to cancer. [3, 5]

Other factors that are likely related to the increased incidence of colon and rectal cancer in young people include: refined food diets high in sugar, obesity, physical inactivity, and diabetes. [6]
