QUERY:  trans male prostate cancer screening
DATE: 01-29-2025
A trans male, meaning someone assigned female at birth who identifies as male, should still get screened for prostate cancer as they retain a prostate gland and can develop prostate cancer, even after gender-affirming hormone therapy; therefore, regular prostate cancer screening, including a PSA blood test and digital rectal exam (DRE), is recommended according to current guidelines for cisgender men, with open communication with their healthcare provider about their gender identity being crucial. [1, 2, 3]

Key points about trans male prostate cancer screening: [1, 2, 4]
Still at risk: Despite gender transition, a trans male still has a prostate and can develop prostate cancer. [1, 2, 4]
Screening methods: The standard prostate cancer screening methods, like a PSA blood test and DRE, are used for trans men. [1, 2, 3]
Importance of communication: Openly discussing gender identity with your healthcare provider is vital to ensure appropriate screening and management. [2, 3, 5]
Potential considerations for trans male prostate cancer screening: [1, 6]
Hormone therapy impact: Gender-affirming hormone therapy can lower PSA levels, which might make detecting prostate cancer more challenging. [1, 6]
Lowered PSA threshold: Some clinicians may consider a lower PSA threshold for trans men due to the potential impact of hormone therapy. [1, 3, 6]
Psychological factors: Transgender individuals might experience anxiety around prostate cancer screening due to stigma or discomfort discussing their anatomy. [2, 6, 7]
