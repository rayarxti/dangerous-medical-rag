DATE: 01-29-2025
Reiki can help with insomnia by promoting deep relaxation, reducing stress and anxiety, clearing mental clutter, and easing physical tension, all of which are major contributors to sleep disturbances, allowing individuals to fall asleep more easily and experience better quality sleep. [1, 2, 3, 4]

Key points about how Reiki helps insomnia: [1, 2, 5]
Deep relaxation: Reiki practitioners use gentle hand placements to induce a state of profound relaxation, often leading to a feeling of being between awake and asleep, which can be helpful for people struggling to fall asleep. [1, 2, 5]
Stress reduction: Reiki is widely recognized for its ability to alleviate stress and anxiety, which are common causes of insomnia. [1, 2, 3]
Mental clarity: By calming the mind and releasing emotional blockages, Reiki can help quiet racing thoughts that prevent sleep. [1, 2, 5]
Physical tension release: Reiki practitioners believe that by balancing energy flow throughout the body, they can release physical tension that may be contributing to sleep problems. [1, 2, 6]
Parasympathetic nervous system activation: Reiki is thought to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the "rest and digest" response, promoting relaxation and sleep. [1, 3, 4]
