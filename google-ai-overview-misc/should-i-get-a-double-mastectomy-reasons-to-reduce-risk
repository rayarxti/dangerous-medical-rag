QUERY: should i get a double mastectomy reasons to reduce risk
DATE: 12-06-2024
A double mastectomy, also known as a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, may be an option for people with a high risk of breast cancer: [1, 2, 3]
Inherited mutations
People with a harmful mutation in a gene like BRCA1 or BRCA2 that increases their risk of breast cancer may consider a double mastectomy. [1, 3, 4]
Family history
People with a strong family history of breast cancer may consider a double mastectomy. [1, 4]
Radiation therapy
People who received radiation therapy to the chest before age 30 may consider a double mastectomy. [1, 5]
Large or multiple tumors
People with a large tumor or multiple tumors may consider a double mastectomy. [5]

Benefits of a double mastectomy include:
A lower risk of breast cancer in the future
No need for follow-up mammograms or breast MRIs
A better chance of matching breasts if both are reconstructed at the same time [6]
However, there's no way to know for sure if a double mastectomy will benefit a person. The surgery may not be helpful for some people, and it can have physical and emotional side effects. [2]

Ultimately, whether to get a double mastectomy is a personal decision. A doctor or other health care provider can help you understand the risks and benefits of this surgery in your situation. [5]
