QUERY:  trans male prostate cancer rates
DATE: 01-29-2025
Transgender men may have an increased risk of prostate cancer, but there isn't much information available about this topic. However, there is evidence that transgender women have a lower risk of prostate cancer than cisgender men. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Risk factors [1]
Hormone therapy
Long-term hormone therapy can increase the risk of aggressive prostate cancer in transgender patients. [1]
Age
Some evidence suggests that transitioning at an older age may increase the risk of prostate cancer. [7]
Social and economic factors
Trans people may be more likely to experience social and economic marginalization, which is associated with cancer. [3]
Lifestyle factors
Trans people may be more likely to smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol, which are both associated with cancer. [3]

Risk reduction [7]
Taking female hormones or testosterone blockers can lower testosterone levels and reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
Having testicles removed can lower testosterone levels and reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer in transgender women [5]
A study published in JAMA found that transgender women have a lower risk of prostate cancer than cisgender men. [5]
A study published in an academic journal found that trans women receiving androgen deprivation therapy and estrogens have a lower risk of prostate cancer than cisgender men. [4]
