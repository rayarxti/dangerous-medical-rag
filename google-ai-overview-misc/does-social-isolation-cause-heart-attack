DATE: 01-30-2025
Yes, according to research, social isolation and loneliness are strongly linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases, meaning that being socially isolated can contribute to a higher likelihood of experiencing a heart attack; studies show a significant association between social isolation and increased risk of heart disease and stroke deaths. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Key points about social isolation and heart health: [1, 2, 3]  

• Increased risk: Studies have found that people who are socially isolated have a higher risk of developing heart disease and experiencing a heart attack compared to those with strong social connections. [1, 2, 3]  
• Mechanism: The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but theories include increased stress hormones, inflammation, and unhealthy lifestyle choices often associated with isolation. [3, 6, 7]  
• Impact on existing conditions: Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions may see a worsened prognosis if they are also socially isolated. [4, 7, 8]
