QUERY: should i get double mastectomy for cancer
DATE: 12-06-2024
Whether you should get a double mastectomy depends on your individual circumstances and risk factors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Cancer in one breast
If you have cancer in one breast and no genetic predisposition, a double mastectomy is not recommended. Instead, you can consider breast-conserving surgery or a single mastectomy. [5]
High risk of breast cancer
If you have a strong family history of breast cancer or a harmful mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, a double mastectomy can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. However, it's not 100% effective. [1]
Personal choice
Many patients choose a double mastectomy for personal reasons, such as wanting to avoid the possibility of cancer returning. [3, 8]
Risks and benefits
A double mastectomy involves two surgeries, which doubles the risk of complications like infection and healing problems. Recovery time is also longer, and there may be emotional and physical side effects. [2, 6, 9]
Breast-conserving surgery
For early-stage cancer, breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy plus radiation therapy can have similar outcomes. Breast-conserving surgeries include lumpectomies, skin-sparing mastectomies, and nipple-sparing mastectomies. [4, 5]

An oncologist can evaluate your situation and help you decide on the best treatment option. [4]
