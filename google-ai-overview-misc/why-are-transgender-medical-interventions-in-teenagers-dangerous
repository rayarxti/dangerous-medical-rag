QUERY: why are transgender medical interventions in teenagers dangerous
SEARCH DATE: 01-30-2025
Transgender medical interventions for teenagers can be dangerous because there is a lack of long-term research and because they involve known and unknown risks. [1, 2, 3]  
Risks [1]  

Hormone therapy 

Cross-sex hormones can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, blood clots, and cancer. There is also a risk of fertility reduction, but it's not clear if this is reversible. [1, 2]  

Surgery 

Surgery can improve appearance and satisfaction, but it has a significant rate of complications. [4]  

Puberty suppression 

There is weak evidence that early puberty suppression impacts gender dysphoria or mental health. [3]  

Long-term impact 

There isn't enough research on the long-term impact of taking hormones for many years. [2]  


Lack of research [1]  

• There are no long-term studies that show the safety or effectiveness of transgender interventions for children. [1]  
• There is a lack of long-term follow-up data on those who start treatment at an earlier age. [3]  

Mental health [5]  

• Blocking access to timely care can increase the risk of suicidal ideation and other negative mental health outcomes. 

Patient autonomy [4]  

• Clinicians need to determine when an adolescent has the capacity to consent to potentially irreversible interventions.
