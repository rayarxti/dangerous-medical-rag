QUERY: social risk factors causing heart failure
DATE: 01-30-2025
Social risk factors that can contribute to heart failure include: low socioeconomic status, lack of access to healthcare, poor education levels, unemployment, social isolation, chronic stress, neighborhood safety concerns, food insecurity, and racial/ethnic disparities, all of which can influence lifestyle choices and ability to manage health conditions, leading to increased risk of heart failure development. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  
Key points about social risk factors and heart failure: [4, 8, 10]  

• Socioeconomic status: Low income, low educational attainment, and unemployment are strongly associated with a higher risk of heart failure. [4, 8, 10]  
• Access to healthcare: Limited access to quality healthcare, including preventative care, can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of heart conditions. [3, 4, 7]  
• Social isolation and loneliness: Lack of social support and feelings of isolation can negatively impact cardiovascular health and increase the risk of heart failure. [5, 9, 11]  
• Stressful living conditions: Chronic stress from work, family, or neighborhood issues can contribute to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks. [3, 6, 7]  
• Food insecurity: Limited access to healthy food options can lead to poor diet choices, increasing the risk of heart disease. [3, 4, 12]  
• Racial/ethnic disparities: Certain minority groups often experience higher rates of heart failure due to systemic inequalities in healthcare access and social determinants of health. [2, 4, 13]  

How social factors can impact heart failure: [1, 3, 6]  

• Lifestyle behaviors: Individuals facing social disadvantages may be more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption due to limited resources and stress. [1, 3, 6]  
• Adherence to treatment: Socioeconomic barriers can hinder medication adherence and following treatment plans for heart failure. [4, 6, 8]  
• Psychological impact: Chronic stress and social isolation can contribute to mental health issues like depression and anxiety, further impacting cardiovascular health. [3, 5, 6]
